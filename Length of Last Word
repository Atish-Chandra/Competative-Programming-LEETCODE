Length of Last Word

Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.

A word is a maximal 
substring
 consisting of non-space characters only.


Example 1:

Input: s = "Hello World"
Output: 5
Explanation: The last word is "World" with length 5.
Example 2:

Input: s = "   fly me   to   the moon  "
Output: 4
Explanation: The last word is "moon" with length 4.
Example 3:

Input: s = "luffy is still joyboy"
Output: 6
Explanation: The last word is "joyboy" with length 6.
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 104
s consists of only English letters and spaces ' '.
There will be at least one word in s.

SOLUTION:-

1st method(by splitting words)
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLastWord(self, s: str) -> int:
        '''# Step 1: Trim any trailing spaces
         s = s.strip()
    
    # Step 2: Split the string into words
         words = s.split()
    
    # Step 3: Return the length of the last word
         return len(words[-1])'''

2nd method(by counting from the last)
        length = 0
        i = len(s) - 1

    # Step 2: Skip trailing spaces
        while i >= 0 and s[i] == ' ':
            i -= 1

    # Step 3: Count the length of the last word
        while i >= 0 and s[i] != ' ':
            length += 1
            i -= 1

        return length
